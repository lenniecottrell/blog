title: Welcome to the blog!

This is the first post in my new blog. I tried out WordPress, but it was too bulky for my needs and it ate the site I designed, so I want to get back to having full control of my site and keeping my blog as minimal as possible. Thanks to Barry Clark for the quick and easy GitHub Pages blog setup using Jekyll!

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
