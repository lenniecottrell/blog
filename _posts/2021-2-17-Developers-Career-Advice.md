title: Developers Give Great Career Advice
---

_tl;dr: Developers are algorithmic problem solvers. Getting a job is a problem to be solved, therefore devs (or former devs) offer career advice as an algorithm_

I spent a chunk of last week watching presentations from the Software Engineer Success Summit, put together by ByteByByte.com. I thought it was a well designed COVID-era event.

Each day, 4 talks were made available for 24 hours. Since the whole thing was online and available to anyone, this structure made the event pretty acessible to anyone, assuming they could make time each day to watch the videos. None of the presentations was longer than an hour though, so you could easily pick and choose what was valuable based on where you were with your career and job search.

Most of the presentations had a similar structure: present a framework or roadmap, talk through each main point, and offer specific ways to implement the framework or follow the roadmap.

What I realized after the second or third of these, is that the presenters, who were all developers or former developers, were offering an _algorithm_ for improving the job hunt success rate. There was a concrete set of steps that, if performed correctly, would likely increase your chances of success.

There was a set of steps to help use LinkedIn as a networking tool. A set of steps to work through technical interviews. A set of steps to prepare for an interview in a month, a week, or a day. There was always a set of steps.

Free job-hunting advice is often hit-or-miss, and most of the presentations at this event I found to be hits. I was impressed with how much concrete, actionable advice was offered, and I'm looking forward to implementing it into my job hunt.
