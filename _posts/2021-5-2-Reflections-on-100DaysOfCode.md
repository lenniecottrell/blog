title: A Reflection On The 100DaysOfCode Challenge
---

### tl;dr: Consistency is paramount when learning to code. Networking is your best friend in the job hunt. Process is more important than product for sustainability as a developer.

I wrapped up my first round of #100DaysOfCode on the second day of work at my first full-time job in the tech industry. It felt like the perfect transition, because I could not have landed this job without #100DaysOfCode. Over the course of the challenge I learned a lot about coding, about consistency, [about the job hunt](https://lenniecottrell.github.io/Reflections-On-The-Job-Search/), and about myself over the course of my challenge (plus I got married!).

I saw a post on LinkedIn a while back about bootcamps graduating people who are "pre-junior." Honestly, this is exactly how I felt. I was not job-ready after the bootcamp, and I bet that's reality for a lot of people. No bootcamp is perfect and mine certainly had its holes, but I also probably should have approached it differently.

I was the type of bootcamp student who was focused on the finish line instead of truly understanding before moving to the next step. I have learned that there is a balance between forging ahead even when you don't fully understand something, and taking the time to truly digest what you're learning, but during my bootcamp I was too focused on finishing and starting my job search that I didn't take the necessary time to internalize my studies. This meant that when I was done, I didn't feel like I had much to show for it.

My bootcamp didn't leave me with projects I was proud of, and my skills felt underdeveloped for someone trying to do technical work. #100DaysOfCode was my solution to that, and it was a good solution. **#100DaysOfCode post-bootcamp was the best thing I could have done to prepare for a tech job.**

I related deeply to the points laid out in [this post](https://www.thinkful.com/blog/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard/) about the emotional journey of learning to code. There's a chart partway through that plots Confidence vs Competance for a beginning coder. When I started #100DaysOfCode, I was at the Cliff of Confusion, and sank quickly into the Desert of Despair. I believe that this challege took me all the way through the Upswing of Awesome, because by the end, I LOVED the work. I still had (have) a long way to go, but I finally felt like I kind of knew what I was doing.

## What I Learned About Code

The **most important** thing about code that I learned from the challenge is to be consistent. Be consistent with coding regularly, be consistent with the language and tools you use when you're learning, and be consistent with your conventions. Consistency in these areas is what enabled me to approach job interviews with some confidence.

Before I started the challenge, I was jumping around from language to language, project to project, learning resource to learning resource, feeling scattered and barely progressing. When I chose to focus in on JavaScript, React, freeCodeCamp (for drilling fundamentals and doing practice problems), and one project, my learning accelerated dramatically.

I needed a project that I felt proud of to put in my portfolio. I wanted it to be a full-stack project, and I wanted it to be useful to me, so I decided to make a flashcard app to help myself study programming terminology. Based on what I was seeing in job posts, I decided I would use React, Node, Express, and PostgreSQL for my stack.

At the beginning of this, I knew nothing about React. I started with their official walk-though where I built a tic-tac-toe game, I did a couple of small YouTube tutorials as well, but the thing that really accelerated my understanding was purchasing the React course by a Youtuber called DevEd. His courses were entertaining and consistent, and his teaching style is easy to follow. Without the prior training in Javascript it would have been way over my head, but I was at the right place to get a lot out of that course.

Now I love using React! I enjoy building with it, and I would feel comfortable if someone asked me to build something with it. I'm obviously still a beginner, but I understand the parts and basic functionality. I hope my career involves building with React at some point.

Coding every day was the most valuable way to have spent my time while I was unemployed. Without it I wouldn't have built an app I'm proud of, I wouldn't feel as confident as I do, and

## What I Learned About Myself

Learning to code has made me address the fact that I have always put product over process, and that holds you back when you're a developer. Enjoying coding (which I do!) means enjoying the process. It means enjoying the problems and enjoying the search for solutions; it means enjoying refactoring and improving inefficient code. If you spend the whole time focused on the end, you can never enjoy the middle, and the middle is **most of the time**.

Enjoying the process also means enjoying learning, because learning takes time. I needed to be okay with the discomfort of only understanding something a little bit, and needed to trust that with time, patience, and consistency, a deeper understanding would come. I should have known this as an educator and musician, but sometime we need new perspectives to really teach us the deeper truths.

## Plans for the next #100DaysOfCode

Even though I'm only two weeks in to my job, I already understand how hard it can be to work on side projects while you're working full time and have a life you want to live. But I do plan on doing another round if the challenge, probably later this year.

During this round, I grew my skills with:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- NodeJS
- Express
- PostgreSQL
- Framer Motion
- Algorithmic thinking

In the next round, I want to grow my skills with and/or learn about:

- JavaScript
- React
- Framer Motion and other animation libraries (three.js, anime.js, WebGL)
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- GraphQL
- Game Dev (I want to make a game as a project!)
- Python (This will probably have to wait for round 3)

I'm so happy to have a job, and I'm so glad to have found a new career where I'll constantly be learning.
