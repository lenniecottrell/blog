title: The Emotional Rewards Of Getting Back Into A Project
---

I spent most of March working on practice problems and prepping for interviews. This was the right way to spend my time, because it turned into a job, but it meant my flashcard project took a backseat and I basically didn't work on it for a month.

I spent my coding time before I start my new job jumping back into the flashcard app, and it's been a really interesting experience getting back into it!

I've heard before that taking an extended break from a codebase can mean that you forget most of how it works, but I didn't have that experience. It was pretty easy for me to jump right back in and remember how it was structured. Maybe that's because I built the whole thing. Maybe it's because I'm the only one working on it so no one's made any changes I haven't seen. Either way, I'm glad it was easy to get back into it.

The more building I do, the more learning I have to do also, and the more complex the app gets. This has now created a familiar web of bugs and problems to solve. "Where is this component going to go? Oh wait if that goes there, this needs to go inside it. Wait, that messes up the styles how do I fix that? Wait, now I have one form sending data in two directions, how does that work?"

The to-do list piles up extremely fast. It gets overwhelming, but now, with a month break, it actually feels _good_. I'm excited to tackle all of these thing. I enjoy the feeling of needing to untie the logical knot of code to develop this app the way I want it to be.

It was interesting to me to experience a feeling of familiarity with writing code. This speaks to the importance of breaks, and the value of consistency. (That may seem contradictory. I took a break from this project, but I've been consistently thinking about code and working on other programming issues. ).

I may be speaking too soon, but I feel like I may be turning a corner in my learning, into a point of confidence that can only be achieved with time and practice.
