title: Reflections On The Job Search
---

(updated 5/2/21)

Last week, I verbally accepted an offer for my first full time tech job. Compared to others I've seen on Reddit, my job serch was relatively short, but that doesn't mean it was any less difficult, stressful, greuling, or emotionally draining.

I finished my bootcamp in October of 2020, and I was employed part time until the end of December. I started applying for jobs in December, and between December and the end of March 2021 I applied to about 45 jobs. Of those, I got

- 33 rejections
- 10 companies ghosted
- 2 interviews (which was actually 7 rounds of interviews and one take-home assessment)
- 1 offer

### Most Important takeaway

The most important thing I did to find a job was networking. I ended up getting a job at a company that had an early version of my tech resume - that means it was without any impressive projects on it or any of the things I learned in January and February of 2021. I got the interview because I connected with someone at the company and had a good conversation. The other interview I got was for the same reason.

The time spent working on projects and growing my knowledge was important and valuable, and will make me a better employee, but the thing that got me the interview in the first place was making a connection with someone who could flag my resume.

### Job Hunting Priorities

In my opinion, the order of importance of things that will get you a tech job is this:

1. Connections
2. Resume
3. Coding skills
4. Portfolio

All of these are important and need to be strong, but here's why I ranked them this way:

Connections allow you to skip the resume step entirely, because an actual human will actually pull your resume on purpose. You get to skip the line and jump straight to #3.

If you don't have a connection at a company, you need to tailer your resume very specifically to each place you apply. These days, every tech company has dozens (or sometimes hundreds) of more candidates than they can field, and they all use an Applicant Tracking System (ATS). An ATS is a tool that scans your resume for keywords that match the job description, so if the words on your resume don't match the words on the job post, you don't have a chance. Resources like [JobScan](https://www.jobscan.co) are invaluable when cold-applying.

If your resume is pulled, you need to be able to actually back up what's on it by talking intellegently about your experience and projects, and if you make it to a technical interview, you'll need to be able to actually code.

Once you're actually talking to some people in the company and you've proved that you can actually code, they'll want to talk to you about your projects (hopefully!). That's where an interesting and diverse portfolio of projects comes in, and you should be able to talk enthusiastically about all of it.

### Biggest challenges

The most challenging parts of the job search were finding balance and managing my mental health.

The balance I had to find was between learning, working on projects, applying, and networking. All of these take time, energy, and commitment, and figuring out how to feel successful at all of them was a constant puzzle. I decided at the beginning of January to implement a stripped down agile-like methodology for my time, where I would do a daily, weekly, and monthly recap of my work to set goals, recognize successes, and indentify areas of improvement. This felt good and I plan on continuing it indefinitely.

Constant rejection and feelings of inadequacy make it really tough to stay positive about progress. I was regularly fighting feelings that I hadn't learned enough, wasn't good enough, or wasn't employable. I felt awful about not bringing in income. I felt like the road ahead was dauntingly long.

Finding a community to commiserate with has been a challenge as well. I found it helpful to lurk around r/CSCareerQuestions and r/learnprogramming. I found a mentorship group called CodingCoach, and a monthly meetup group I feel comfortable talking to.

I'm looking forward to getting started with a full-time job in the tech industry, though I know I'll still have to put in extra work to keep my skills sharp, and keep building projects that stretch and challenge me. I still have a long way to go!
