It's been a minute since I've written a new blog post. It's also been a minute since I've done any significant coding.

Unfortunately, this post is not a "Here's how I hacked my schedule to code in my free time" kind of post. This is more like a "I'm struggling with something, and I bet other people struggle with this too" kind of post.

I successfully got hired back in April as a Technical Support Engineer. I did it! I'm in the tech industry! I made the switch!

Well, kinda. Even though I'm successfully employed, I'm not coding for work. If I want to be coding for work, that means I need to keep coding outside of work. When I was job hunting, I had time and energy to code during the day, and could structure my 9-5 "work time" as a combination of job hunting, applying, and coding. Now all of that time is real "work time", and the other time is normally when I would rest.

In thinking about how and when to practice coding now that I'm working full time, I've learned that I have two categories of hobbies:

1. Decompression hobbies: enjoyable, relaxing, and/or not mentally taxing activites like baking, reading, video games, cooking, gardening, and exercise.
2. Skill-building hobbies: activites I want to be better at, which require a certain amount of mental effort, like practicing piano and... coding.

At the end of the day when my brain is tired, it's hard to find the mental energy to begin a skill-building hobby. It's easier and usually desirable to choose a decompression hobby. Also, my brain is significantly fresher in the morning, so I would be more productive if I could code in the morning anyway. Waking up earlier (like 4-5 AM) just makes things harder for me, so that's not an option. On the weekends, I like to spend time with my wife and dogs and friends, so I don't want to do weekend coding marathons either. I know I'll figure something out eventually, but it will inevitably involve a sacrifice somewhere.

There is a certain amount of slack I've been trying to allow myself in this struggle, which is that I've just completely changed my work circumstances. New job, new hours, new type of work, new work environment, etc., so an adjustment period should be expected. It will change a little bit again when my wife goes back to teaching in the fall, but I'm beginning to feel like the adjustment period should be coming to an end.

I do know other people struggle with this if they work full time and like to code for fun, but everyone's circumstances are different, and I just need to continue to figure out what works for me.
