title: Solo Progress vs Tutorial Progress

A common bit of advice I hear about learning to code is "build stuff." There comes a point in the learning process where you need to abandon the hand-holding of courses and tutorials and forge your own path ahead. There are a few articles I've read about this that articulate it much more clearly than I can ([1](http://blog.thefirehoseproject.com/posts/learn-to-code-and-be-self-reliant/?utm_source=pocket-ff-recs), [2](https://www.thinkful.com/blog/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard/)), but this really is the best advice.

I started building a flashcard app because I wanted a study tool, and I wanted to build a full stack app on my own. As I've worked through it, I've had to make detours every so often to read some articles or find a short tutorial to learn more about a piece of tech I didn't know well enough yet. These tutorials have been extremely helpful in understanding the tools I'm using, but they're only every going to be an introduction.

The real learning comes with actually figuring it out yourself, and that takes time. A lot of time.

My big win today was that I successfully rendered the topics in my database as items in a dropdown list, and then successfully changed the state of my components based on the selection from the dropdown list.

If I were following a tutorial, this probably would have been a 3-5 minute segment and it would have felt like a simple, rudimentary accomplishment.

Honestly, it probably IS a rudimentary accomplishment, but since I was figuring it out on my own, in my own project with my own code and my own database and my own API, it took me about an hour and a half.

I used to get really stressed about how much time this takes, but I'm getting better at understanding that this is the important stuff. Real understanding takes  time. 

"Tutorial hell" is a thing because it's easy to be lulled into a false sense of understanding. Code makes a lot more sense when someone else has already done the debugging, and they can explain the logic to you clearly. But tutorial hell is a self-defeating cycle because you don't leave a tutorial with true understanding of what you set out to learn in the first place. Using tutorials as tools to learn *concepts*, and then applying those concepts to your own projects is how real understanding begins to form.
