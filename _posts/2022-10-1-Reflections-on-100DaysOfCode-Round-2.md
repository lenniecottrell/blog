title: Reflections on 100DaysOfCode Round 2
---

_tl;dr - #100DaysOfCode is absolutely the best way to grow as a programmer, I look forward to round 3._

## Here are the most important things I learned or did over this round of #100DaysOfCode:

- [I built a portfolio project I'm actually proud of](https://shelf.fly.dev)
- Keeping a daily log is absolutely essential
- I finally started learning about data structures and algorithms (DSA)

Here were my stated goals from the outset. I had pared the list down to keep it achievable:

> 1. Learning DS&A (using [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpPXw4zFa0uKKhaSz87IowJnOTzh9tiBk))
> 2. Learning how to solve leetcode questions
> 3. Building small React projects with different free APIs
> 4. Building sample CRUD apps

In the end, even this list was too broad. Here is what I actually achieved over the 100 Days:

- [Built one React project](https://shelf.fly.dev), using Vite, Express, and the Google Books API.
- Started learning about DSA - I got through linked lists and about halfway through hashing in the playlist I linked. I plan to continue learning through this playlist.
- I reversed a linked list on my own without looking up solutions(!).
- I solved three leetcode problems on linked lists.
- I learned more about the infrastructure of deploying an app, and realized I didn't need to be paying GoDaddy for my portfolio website, so I moved my domains to a cheaper registrar and cancelled my auto-renews with GoDaddy. Should save me a couple hundred bucks a year!

So from the original goals, I'd say I checked off items 1, 2, and 3 (even though it was just one project), and didn't get to 4 at all.

As for next time, here's what I'd love to work on:

- More leetcode
- A project with a database maybe (revisit/rebuild the flashcard app?)
- Python (I have some resources to get through, and I really should finish Automate the Boring Stuff)

## Thoughts on this round.

One major difference between this round and last round is that I'm working full time now, so my time was significantly more limited. The minimum for #100DaysOfCode is 1 hour per day, and most days in this round that's as much as I could put in towards learning. Even with only 1 hour a day though, it's amazing how much you can achieve in 100 days.

With a full time job and a wife I like to hang out with (and dogs, and hobbies), the best (and honestly only) time I can set aside for this is in the early morning. It's not for everyone, but it worked for me - my bedtime became between 9:30 and 10, and my alarm was set for 5. I actually ended up loving the routine of getting up super early, making coffee, and getting to work on my own stuff for an hour before the rest of the day go started. Next time, I'll have a young child and I'll have to figure out a new routine, but I'm hopeful a similar schedule to work.

In addition to the **consistency** of sticking with a codebase, problem, or topic every day, the most helpful tool in my growth as a programmer during this round is my own daily standup. I kept a [daily log](https://github.com/lenniecottrell/100Days-r2) structured like this:

#### Things I accomplished today:

#### Things I want to focus on tomorrow:

#### Notes/Learnings:

#### To Do:

I call it my personal daily standup. At the end of my session I fill out each section, and at the beginning of my next day I review it and it jump-starts my brain to get back into what I was working on the day before. Also, this way I have a running log of my to-do list and everything I've achieved over the course of the 100 Days.

The personal daily standup is a practice I will bring into my work and any personal projects I do in the future. It's so easy to forget what you were working on or what needed to be done when you step away from a codebase even for a short time, so keeping track like this was invaluable.

#100DaysOfCode has proven to be a powerful framework for growing as a developer, and I've learned a ton from both rounds now. Whenever I feel like I need to make bigger steps, I'll start this process again. I should aim to do it at least once a year.
