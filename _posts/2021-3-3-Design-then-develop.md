title: Design, then develop.
---

Yesterday I had finished a lot of the essential functionality of my flashcard app and I was ready to do a significant overhaul of the UI. I wanted it to look modern and sleek, but my skills are not in design (though I want them to be someday!)

Luckily, I'm engaged to a designer!

I handed it over to her and she did a little bit of research and made a mockup on InDesign that looked super modern and clean, then it was my task to recreate it.

This was awesome for two reasons:
1) This is exactly the kind of work I'd like to do
2) It made me rethink the architechture of my UI.

First of all, I want to be a front-end developer - I want  designer to hand me a mock up and I want to make it functional. I got to experience this workflow, and it felt really good.

Second of all, the way my fiance designed the UI and the way I had put it together were pretty different, and her design required my components to be structured differently. Luckily for me, this is one of the strengths of React, so it wasn't too hard to move things around, but it was interesting thinking about how a good design informed the architecture of the code. 

I've been trying to spend more time planning before I dive into coding, and this is even more reinforcement of that idea. Good planning allows you to anticipate problems and begin to solve them before you write your first line of code.
