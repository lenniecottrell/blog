tl;dr - [I made a Geordi La Forge quote generator!](https://lenniecottrell.github.io/geordi-quote-gen/)

During the pandemic, one of the go-to television shows for my fiance and me has been Star Trek: The Next Generation. I have always been a Star Wars fan, but I knew very little about Star Trek. I have become a total convert. Star Trek is amazing! The visionary presentation of the way the world could be is unbelievable, especially in 2021. The brilliance of Star Trek in 2021 deserves its own post.

I am especially tickled by the future-tech-engineering jargon spouted by Chief Engineer Geordi La Forge and future-biotech jargon from Beverly Crusher. Games like SpaceTeam and Among Us play on the hilarious combinations of words invented by the Star Trek writers, and I wanted to give my shot at a tribute.

I’ve seen quote generators on other junior dev’s portfolios, and it’s one of the projects suggested by freeCodeCamp, a favorite resource of mine. I went to sleep last night thinking about a Geordi La Forge quote generator, and woke up early with it on my mind as well.

I searched for a Star Trek technobabble quote generator and found a few decent options, but the best gem was a jargon table for a Star Trek-themed tabletop RPG. Using those values, I created lists of words to use, and randomly selected works from the list to insert into a few different mad-libs style templates.

I was able to build this project in a single day, which is a big win for me because it’s been a hard week. Job hunting is really tough emotionally, and the flashcard app is proving way more complicated than I anticipated. It was nice to knock out a fun mini-project that I could throw on my portfolio.
