Before I learned to code, I was a music teacher. I made music with kids every day, and tried to teach them how to make music that affected their audience. I also started two professional choirs, each focused on telling emotionally compelling stories through creative programming. The thing that has always driven me has been emotional impact, and this hasn't changed as I've reshaped my professional identity as a software developer.

The thing that “hooked” me into music when I was younger was when I learned about music theory. High school me was baffled that music actually had STRUCTURE and RULES. Music isn’t an innate gift - you can learn the rules! Then you take those rules, practice them over and over, and you can make sounds that hit people right in the heart and soul. It still blows my mind. I fell in love with the marraige of logical structure and creative freedom.

Coding, to me, is exactly the same. There are logical rules (which are, at their deepest core, actually governed by the laws of physics), but then you take those rules and you can create these amazing unbelievable things, and when it’s done right, it makes people FEEL something.

I started learning to code in March of 2020. I feel very much like [the way Ira Glass describes creative people who are new to creating.](https://vimeo.com/85040589) I know what I like and what I want to be able to do, but my skills don’t yet match the quality of the things I want to make. Accepting the fact that I am a beginner and that learning to code takes time (a long time!) has been a humbling part of the beginning of my journey.

However, I love coding! I love the discovery process and I love how simple steps evolve into complex structures. Knowing that I’m always learning and that I can reshape my career around this activity keeps me focused and energized. I look forward to building interesting things in my career with my new skillset. Stay tuned!
