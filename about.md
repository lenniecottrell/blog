I am a developer from Portland, Oregon. I am inspired by tech that makes an impact on people's emotions. I used to be a music teacher, and I'm still involved in professional music, but the thing that has always driven me has been emotional impact.

The thing that "hooked" me into music when I was younger was when I learned about music theory. High school me was baffled that music actually had STRUCTURE and RULES. Music isn't an innate gift - you can learn the rules! Then you take those rules and make these sounds that hit people right in the heart and soul. It still blows my mind. I fell in love with the marraige of logical structure and creative freedom.

Coding, to me, is exactly the same. There are logical rules (which, fundamentally, are actually governed by the laws of physics), but then you take those rules and you can create these amazing unbelievable things, and when it done right, it makes people FEEL something.

I started learning to code in March of 2020. I am a junior developer. I feel very much like the way [Ira Glass describes creative people who are new to creating.](https://vimeo.com/85040589). I know what I like and what I want to be able to do, but my skills don't yet match the quality of the things I want to make.

### More Information

My skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, SQL, and some Python.

I'm focused on improving my React skills at the moment, but I'm interested in diving much deeper into NodeJS and React-Native for mobile development.

Things I want to learn more about eventually include animations with anime.js, 3D rendering with three.js, game development with JavaScript (maybe Unity some day!), and machine learning with Python.
